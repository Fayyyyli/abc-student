The web of the mid 90's sounds ideal and peaceful in Lialina’s depiction: passionate amateur wrote their personal websites and enjoyed the process of creating and developing them, as well as using them to share and communicate. They were excited about the web because of its novelty. Though users today may spend more time online than people used to, they don’t care much about the Web itself—it’s only a tool/media. The web is becoming more commercialized and standardized as professionals become the major creator.

The glittering gifs remind me of my early experiences with the web, though it was what Lialina called “a trademark of today’s amateur aesthetics” in 2007. It has been 15 years since she wrote it, and the glitter graphic now has become the style of the past as well. It’s certainly a reflection of the changes in visual aesthetics but also of a trend that the visuals of the web are less personal and more unified. Though many changes have taken place(including many links in the articles that are now expired), I’m not surprised to see that cats have been a popular topic since the very beginning(who doesn’t love cats anyway?)
