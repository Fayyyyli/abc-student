We constantly talk about what anonymity brings to virtual world, at least this is what I thought when reading the first part of the article. With a brand new avatar and new name, one can give him or herself a completely new identity and reborn as a different person. I've seen so many people on social media who pretend to be someone they are actually not and find it satisfying, or people who say or do whatever they want without having to face the concequences. Infidelity brings them joy in a way they cannot get in the reality. Breaking free from the restrictions of reality enables more creativity, and yet can be traumatizing for other people too, like for the victims in Julie’s case. 
 
But what impresses me most is “both virtual and actual are equally real.” When I thought about biological body and online identity, it seems so normal to start from the reality, from the perspective of a living person, instead of the virtual world. No matter the virtual body is the ideal projection of oneself or expression the of freewill, it all seems so natural—because that’s what we humans do. But AGNES is different. What will happen when you put an unembodied AI as the center of a topic regarding physical body? We tend to overlook and exclude other kinds in this discussion, because we are privileged wit humanity. But the lifeless codes now endow with her emotion and make her like a human, blurring the boundaries between real and virtual. The virtual body then becomes her real body, and the virtual world is the world she exists in—doesn’t it make the virtual world a real one for her? We are intimidated by how real she is, but our intention exhibited in virtual world is real too. If something in it is real, then how can one say the virtual world isn’t?
